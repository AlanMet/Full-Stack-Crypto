# Project Overview

This is a simple, full-stack web application built with Python and Flask that simulates a basic cryptocurrency wallet system. Users can view their wallets, check balances, mine new blocks, and send transactions. The application uses a mock blockchain to handle transactions and balances, providing a hands-on demonstration of key blockchain concepts.
